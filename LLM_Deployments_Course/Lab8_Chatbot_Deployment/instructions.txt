# Instructions for Lab 8: Chatbot Deployment

This lab converts your summarisation model into an interactive, stateless chatbot.

Steps:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` if locally
2. Review `chatbot.py`:
   - The script loads the model and processes user input to produce a summary.
3. (Optional) Run `download_models.py` to cache models.
4. Execute with: `python chatbot.py`
5. Interact with the chatbot (type 'exit' to quit).
