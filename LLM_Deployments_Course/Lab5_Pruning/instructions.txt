# Instructions for Lab 5: Model Pruning

This lab prunes the t5-small model to remove redundant weights.

Steps:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` if locally
2. Review `starter_code.py`:
   - The script loads the model, prints the total parameter count, and prunes each Linear layer (20% via L1 unstructured pruning).
3. Execute with: `python starter_code.py`
4. Verify output; note that many weights have been zeroed.
