# Instructions for Lab 12: AWS ECS Scaling with Terraform

This lab extends your AWS ECS deployment to include scaling with a load balancer.

Steps:
1. Ensure AWS CLI and Terraform are installed.
2. Review the Terraform files:
   - `provider.tf` sets the AWS provider.
   - `variables.tf` defines necessary variables.
   - `main.tf` creates an ECS cluster, task definition, an ALB with target group and listener, and an ECS service with 2 tasks.
   - `outputs.tf` outputs the ECS cluster ID and the ALB DNS name.
3. Update `variables.tf` as needed.
4. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
5. Deploy with: `terraform apply`
6. Note the ALB DNS name from the outputs.
7. Test the deployment by accessing the ALB endpoint in your browser.
