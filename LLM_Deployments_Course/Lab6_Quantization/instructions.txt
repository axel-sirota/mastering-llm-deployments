# Instructions for Lab 6: Model Quantization

This lab applies one of three quantization approaches.

Steps:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` if locally
2. Review `starter_code.py` to see how the script selects a quantization mode based on the command-line argument.
3. Run with a mode, for example: `python starter_code.py int8`
4. The quantized model is saved in a folder named according to the mode.
5. Note: Training-Aware Quantization is only simulated.
